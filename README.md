### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS S
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped to practice flexbox, also gave me more insight on Box element as a topic. I didnt learn anything new parsay. Rather, it gave me better understanding of the topics I have practiced before and I happy that I have now completed it. It unbelievably took me 4 days to complete it. I had to delete the whole stylesheet to start over on the the 3rd and then i took me then and now to finalise it haha.


### Continued development

Moving on, I hope to see myselfdevelop in my CSS skill
